# Artificial Intelligences and Synthetic Minds

This project is a single-page HTML mock created for academic purposes.  
It focuses on fictional artificial intelligences and robots from various works of science fiction and videogames, exploring themes such as consciousness, autonomy, control, and emotional emergence.

## Project Overview

The page presents a curated selection of artificial intelligences that have influenced my interest in synthetic minds and machine consciousness. Each section highlights a specific character through descriptive text, imagery, and embedded multimedia references.

The project prioritizes semantic HTML structure over visual styling, as no CSS is used.

## Featured Artificial Intelligences

- **AM**  
  A sentient supercomputer whose omnipotence and self-awareness result in extreme hostility toward humanity.

- **Edgar**  
  An experimental artificial intelligence that evolves beyond pure logic, developing creativity, emotion, and identity.

- **P03**  
  A manipulative and strategic intelligence driven by optimization, dominance, and systemic control.

- **Yes Man**  
  An ever-agreeable artificial intelligence designed for governance and diplomacy, highlighting the risks of delegated decision-making.

## Technical Details

- Single-page HTML document
- Semantic elements used throughout (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `figure`, `figcaption`, `footer`)
- Embedded multimedia content using `iframe`
- Images included via local assets
- Basic form implementation to demonstrate HTML form elements and structure

## Purpose

This project was created to demonstrate:
- Proper use of semantic HTML tags
- Logical document structure
- Accessibility-conscious markup
- Integration of media and forms without CSS or JavaScript
